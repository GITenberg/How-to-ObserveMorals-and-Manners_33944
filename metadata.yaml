description: "How to Observe Morals and Manners is a sociological treatise on methods\
  \ of observing manners and morals written by Harriet Martineau in 1837–8 after a\
  \ tour of America. She stated that she wasn't looking for fodder for a book, but\
  \ also privately remarked that \"I am tired of being kept floundering among the\
  \ details which are all a Hall and a Trollope (writer of Domestic Manners of the\
  \ Americans) can bring away.”\nAs opposed to Victorian prescriptive handbooks of\
  \ how societies ought to behave, Martineau focuses on observing locals on their\
  \ own terms and emphasizes the need to accept cultural relativism of other people.\n\
